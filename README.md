On John's advice I've scaled the original idea back, trimming table requirements down and stripping most of the login functionality.
Endpoints now are;
1) one database table with link to Mp3 files and basic data.
2) login feature to comprise a single, pre-defined password to access table info.
3) ability for user to add an Mp3 link to the table.

Things that've gone well;
I'm starting to get a feel for at least what interactions occur across the spectrum and what
syntax to look out for that may make those interactions and functions happen.
It's been eye-opening to see how long it has taken to get the project just to the point it is.
The most enjoyment I've had is with experimenting with different methods, even if they haven't 
paid off, such as the missing functions, the imported font styling, tweaking the code compared
to the walkthrough, both during and after the fact, which I think demonstrates the beginnings
of understanding how the code is working.
Adding the URL link into HTML over song names when originally separate.
Removing background colours.


Things that've gone less well;
Not grasped Angular enough yet to completely independently code out the extra features of finding
the URL link and deleting an entry.


Things still to do;
I'd like to meet my original brief and make it a useful app, if anything just to meet that goal.
Add the condition that if a track number already exists, it won't add in and will display reason.


Why MySQL?
Seemed easier to persist the tables and data.
More experience with it than H2.

Why Springboot?


Why Angular?


How does everything talk?
