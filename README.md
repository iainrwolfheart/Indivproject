On John's advice I've scaled the original idea back, trimming table requirements down and stripping most of the login functionality.
Endpoints now are;
1) one database table with link to Mp3 files and basic data.
2) login feature to comprise a single, pre-defined password to access table info.
3) ability for user to add an Mp3 link to the table.
